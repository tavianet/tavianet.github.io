						<p>How the Arts Express and Preserve the Spirit of Haiti</p>
					</header>

					<p>The country of Haiti has a tough past that includes famine, poverty, devastating natural disasters, and slave history. As different nationalities arrived and made their mark on the island, Haiti’s culture has evolved and absorbed them. The current food, dance, and art of Haiti is a blend of the history of Haiti and includes French, African, and native Taino influences. One thing that has never changed is the Haitian people’s passion for expressing their emotion through the arts.</p>
					<p>In the wake of the devastating earthquake of 2010, many Haitian artists expressed their raw pain and emotion through art. The religion and culture of Haiti is often a blend of Christianity and Vodoun, a mystical religion steeped in folklore. Blending art and religion has given many Haitians a way to heal and remember their strength and spirit. </p>
					<p>As far as visual arts, painting is one of the most popular mediums throughout Haiti. You can see a concentrated collection of painted Haitian art in the bustling creative district of Jacmel. These expressive and colorful paintings appear on traditional canvas, earthquake rubble, and as murals on walls and fences. Haitians also express their culture and emotion through dance and music, telling important stories and expressing feelings through physical movement. Sculpture is another form of Haitian art and is often created using natural materials or scraps, such as recycled oil drums.</p>
